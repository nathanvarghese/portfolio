## Work Experience
## Experience
- **Graduate Teaching Facilitator**
  - *Department of Aerospace Engineering Sciences, CU Boulder*
  - *Assist with grading, office hours, and invigilation for a class of 174 students in ASEN 3711 - Aerodynamics.*

- **Junior Research Fellow**
  - *Department of Aerospace Engineering, MIT ADT*
  - *Proposed a high-speed dynamic test setup for both large and small solid rocket motors at High Energy Materials Research Laboratories (HEMRL) to study the effects of spin on combustion characteristics.*
  - *Facilitated collaboration between the civil, mechanical, and aerospace departments for composite structural analysis.
  -  Managed and compiled the closure documents including the operating manual, quality assurance plan, engineering drawings, design document of Fragment launcher for the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE).*
  -  *Led the design optimization of a Hybrid Parabolic Disc resulting in 20% increase in the Minimum Factor of Safety and a 12% increase in the Average Factor of Safety at 17000 rpm.*


- **Research Intern**
  - *Armament Research and Development Establishment*
  - *ARDE awarded $56,000 for the development of a rapid high-speed centrifugal fragment launcher for experimental material research. Achieved a 10 fold increase in the frequency of testing at supersonic speeds (M∼1.2) as compared to traditional methods of impact testing*
  - *Designed and simulated the attachment for rotary components using finite element analysis (FEA) in ANSYS for Modal analysis, Factor of Safety, Stress analysis, etc. Investigated the trends in drag coefficient for different design iterations.*
  - *Supervised an 8-member fabrication workshop team and maintained communication with vendors and manufacturers.*

- **Project Intern**
  - *High Energy Materials Research Laboratories*
  - *Led a team of 9 members to design and develop an exhibition model showcasing a vertical static rocket motor test bed. Successfully completed the project within a 2 week time-frame*
  - *Utilized Fusion 360 to design and 3D print the model using PLA filament and laser cutting for detailed components.*

## Projects
- **Development of GUI for NASA Europa Lander**
  - *Designed a sample Python based GUI for NASA Concepts for Ocean worlds Life Detection Technology (COLDTech) project’s proposed Europa lander.*
  - *Used Tkinter to create a GUI with ROS integration that supports actions such as labelling, annotation, etc.*
  - 
- **Design of Robust Attitude Control for a Nanosatellite**
  - *Led the team in the simulation and validation of the Yaw-axis model of a nanosatellite.*
  - *Designed and implemented a robust Pole placement controller using MATLAB and Simulink with an Extended State Observer, which outperformed the PID controller for the same design criteria.*

- **Centre for Research & Innovation, MIT ADT**
  - Project goal of developing an innovative system to intensify the rate of fire of a miniature pellet shooter for agricultural purposes. Awarded the highest grant in the department of $1400.*
  - *Successfully led the team to manufacture and complete the project within an 8-month time frame and on budget.*
  - *Won the **’first’** prize in Aerospace Project Exhibition among 25 teams at MIT ADT Fest 2023.*

- **Development of Hybrid Photovoltaic/Thermal system for a Solar panel**
  - *Designed and experimented with a novel method to boost Solar panel efficiency through passive cooling.*
  - *Over a week-long experiment, the hybrid solar panel demonstrated a 12.52% increase in daily average efficiency compared to the regular panel.*
